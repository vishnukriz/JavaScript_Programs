                                                            failure    -  Repeat the build process
  Plan --> code --> build --> Test  (CI)      ----> Release ------------> 
               build process                                 success   -  (CD)  Deploy --> operate --> Monitor
     <--------------------------------->


  * If we configure Github with jenkins - We only need to commit changes to the source code and Jenkins (automate the build and test for each commit - so we know what is failed and do chnages then and there)
